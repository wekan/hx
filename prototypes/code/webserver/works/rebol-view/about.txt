REBOL/view 2.7.8 Distribution

Released: 7-Jan-2011

Welcome to the world of REBOL.

We're a small group of computer programmers, software engineers, scientists,
hobbyists and students who reject the theory that all software projects must
be large and complex. In fact, we think that 80% of software can be fairly
small and simple, if you understand what you're doing, and you have the right
tool. For us the REBOL language is that tool. It offers a more productive
approach for those who don't accept the status quo.

Of course, there are a few things you'll need to learn. Although we strive
to keep simple things simple, when you're faced with a more complex problem
you need to know the best approach to take. REBOL is a bit like molten metal,
you can pour it into the form you need and hammer it to be sharp and efficient.
However, that skill comes with practice and study. If you already know a
programming language, you'll be at a slight disadvantage, because you'll
need to unlearn a few things first.

To begin, I recommend that you look at examples and tutorials found on the
REBOL website in the Documents section. Always start with something simple
and go from there. I still build each new program that way, even after writing
thousands over the years. It lets you watch your program grow and test your
ideas along the way. If you get frustrated, and we all do at times, there's
a wonderful user group online that might be able to help. Of course, they
also assume that you've searched the documents and done your homework first.
Before long, you'll find yourself helping other new users get started.

Thanks again for trying REBOL, and let's rebel together against the idea
that software must be large and complex.
